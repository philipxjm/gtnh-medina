> - `fluid_telem.lua`: fluid name is `Plutonium 241 Plasma` (no hyphen), matching the actual
>   GTNH 2.9 fluid label — the upstream spelling crashes the fluid node on scan
>   (`attempt to compare number with nil` at scanPlasmaStock) and would report Pu-241 stock as 0.
> - `config.lua` + `hw_telem.lua`: drone names carry their voltage suffix — the real 2.9.0-beta-3 items
>   are `Mining Drone Mk-IX (UHV)` — lowercase k, voltage suffix (byte-verified in-game; beta-2 had `MK`) —
>   so upstream's bare `Mining Drone MK-IX` matches nothing:
>   hw telemetry reports zero drones (masking drill kits too) and the loader could never pull one.
>   (`MK-XIV` doesn't exist in 2.9; its entry is inert.)
> - `config.lua`: Orundum Dust added (`dustTargets` → Lanthanum asteroid, and a 10m condition),
>   plus my stock thresholds.
> - `broker-mk3.lua` + `job_node.lua`: ported to the key-based parametrizer API — GTNH's
>   Computronics driver exposes `setParameter(key, value)` / `getParameters()` (keys are the
>   TecTech NBT keys: `distance`, `parallel`, `cycle`, `cycleDistance`, `range`, `step`), and the
>   numeric `setParameters(hatch, index, value)` upstream calls no longer exists. The broker also
>   pins `parallel` to the job so the machine matches its loaded consumables; `distanceParam` in
>   the module config is legacy/unused.
> - `update.lua` (new): per-node updater — set `ROLE` once, run `update` to re-pull that
>   machine's files from this repo.
>
> Note: the QUICKSTART's "set `targetSide`" step is stale — current telem scripts auto-detect
> the first ME Controller on their network, so each node's cabling must reach exactly one.

# MEDINA — Modular Extraction and Dispatch Intelligence Network Array

Automated wireless mining system for the GTNH Space Elevator. Monitors dust storage levels across your ME network, selects asteroids to target by priority, and loads consumables to drive up to 6 Mining Modules in parallel — all from a single consolidated **Broker MK3** computer.

**Current version: v1.5 (Broker MK3).** A cooperative task scheduler loads all 6 modules concurrently without blocking, achieving ~10× the throughput of the earlier blocking design. The broker dispatches based on telemetry from **three required monitor nodes** — dust (what to mine), hardware (drones/drill kits), and fluid (plasma). It won't start mining until all three report, because mining modules physically require a plasma fluid to operate.

```

Each module has its own ME Interface adapter + transposer; one shared OC Database (slots partitioned per module) holds item fingerprints. Telemetry nodes broadcast on port 2026 (strength 400). The broker drives its modules directly — no separate job-node RPC in the single-broker setup.

## Broker MK3 — Consolidated Cooperative Architecture

**broker-mk3.lua** runs dispatch and consumable loading on one computer. This is the **production version** for MEDINA v1.5.

**Hardware:**
- T2 wireless card (port 2026 in for telemetry)
- T3 GPU + **2 tall × 3 wide T3 screen array**
- **OC Database** — shared consumable storage, partitioned 3 slots per module (M1→1-3, M2→4-6, …). A tier-2 (25-slot) DB covers 6 modules; an MK3 (81-slot) DB covers up to 27.
- **Per-module:** OC Adapter on Mining Module, OC Adapter on ME Interface, Transposer between the interface buffer and the input bus

**Key features:**
1. **Concurrent cooperative loading.** Each module's load runs as a scheduler task (`scheduler.lua` + `loader.lua`). All 6 load at once; the broker never blocks — UI and telemetry stay live throughout. No stagger, no fixed delays.
2. **Self-pacing via read-back.** After writing a fingerprint with `iface.store`, the loader polls `db.get(slot)` until the fingerprint is confirmed, then proceeds — instant when the server is fast, patient when it lags. Replaces guessed sleep constants.
3. **Identity-based item routing.** Items are moved into the input bus by matching their label in the interface buffer, not by trusting slot positions (the ME interface can shuffle buffer slots under load). Each load is verified before the machine is enabled; a bad load ERRORs and auto-recovers in ~10 s rather than running wrong.
4. **Drone-first dispatch with a per-asteroid cap.** Uses the highest-tier available drones first, but no single asteroid may hold more than `floor(totalModules / 2) + 1` modules — so a high-tier target (e.g. Infinity Catalyst) can't starve lower-tier needs. Availability pools subtract drones/kits already committed to busy modules, preventing double-assignment.
5. **Priority-mode boot prompt.** At startup, choose *Threshold* (mine the lowest stock/target ratio first) or *Rarity* (highest dust-priority first, then ratio).

**Throughput:** all 6 modules load in ~1–2 s each and mine in parallel. Measured ~9.4× the earlier blocking design (≈100k → ≈938k Infinity Catalyst dust/hr), confirmed stable over a 12-hour soak test.

**Logging:** via `logger.lua`, configured under `config.logging` (default off; ERROR/WARN still written to `/tmp/spacemining.log`). Backends: `file` (default), `console`, or `loki` if you run Grafana Loki. Each load reports read-back poll counts (`confirm polls d=N t=N r=N, arrive=N`); consistently low counts indicate `store()` is reliable on your setup. The UI also shows a per-module `loaded Xs db:N buf:N` diagnostic.

**Stopping the broker:** break the script in the OC console with **Ctrl+Alt+C**.

## Component Detail

### `config.lua` — Shared Master Configuration

Loaded by every node with `dofile("/home/config.lua")`. Sections:

1. **Drone registry** — maps tier keys (`lv`…`max`) to exact ME item names
2. **Drill consumables** — maps drill material keys to tip/rod item names
3. **Module specs** — max parallels, power, and computation per MK tier
4. **Plasma overdrive specs** — τ (time discount), λ (size bonus), mB per parallel
5. **Cycle mode defaults** — distance sweep range/step for dynamic mode
6. **Asteroid database** — 41 asteroids with materials, weights, size range, distance range, computation, EU/t, drone tier bounds, and spawn weight
7. **Optimization matrix** — per `[moduleTier][asteroid][droneKey]` optimal distance (pre-computed from the Space Elevator Calculator spreadsheet)
8. **Dust target registry** — maps each tracked dust/item name to its source asteroid and a priority number
9. **Module filter blacklist** — high-volume junk ores to exclude from module output
10. **Dust stock thresholds** — `config.conditions` — what the broker uses to decide when to mine
11. **Network settings** — `config.ports` (telemetry=2026; command=2027 reserved for optional remote job nodes), `config.pipelineCheckDelay` (default 120 s)

---

### `dust_telem.lua` — Dust Storage Monitor

**Hardware:** T2 wireless card · T3 GPU · T3 screen · OC Adapter on the **dust-storage ME Controller**

Reads `config.conditions` to know which items and thresholds to track. Queries `adapter.getItemsInNetwork()` and broadcasts a `DUST_UPDATE` payload every `pipelineCheckDelay` seconds (120 s by default — matched to the ore processing pipeline delay so the broker sees real post-processing inventory levels).

Scans for all five plasmas by exact name. Determines the highest-tier plasma currently in stock (from `config.plasmaKeyOrder`, tier-descending). Broadcasts `FLUID_UPDATE` every 10 s with all plasma volumes — the broker uses this for plasma selection regardless of mode.

### `hw_telem.lua` — Hardware Inventory Monitor

Builds reverse-lookup tables from `config.drills` at startup so item matching is exact (e.g. `"Cosmic Neutronium Drill Tip"` → key `cosmicNeutronium`). Drone counts are keyed by drone tier key so the broker can compare against `config.droneTierKeys` directly. Broadcasts `HW_UPDATE` every 10 s.

### `broker-mk3.lua` — Central Controller

**Hardware:** T2 wireless card · T3 GPU · **2 tall × 3 wide T3 screen array** · shared OC Database · per-module ME-interface adapter + transposer + module adapter

On startup it prompts for **priority mode** (Threshold ratio vs Rarity first), then draws the dashboard and runs the main loop.

**Dispatch** (drone-first, on a short interval):
1. Build a needs list from `config.conditions` — items below their `amountToMaintain` threshold, sorted by the chosen priority mode.
2. Compute availability pools: drones and drill kits in stock **minus** those already committed to busy modules (prevents double-assigning one physical drone).
3. Iterate drones highest-tier first; for each, find a needed asteroid that drone can mine and that is **under its per-asteroid module cap** (`floor(totalModules/2)+1`).
4. Assign an idle module: set status LOADING and `spawn` a cooperative load task. Loads run concurrently; the loop never blocks.

**Module lifecycle:** `IDLE → LOADING (load task) → RUNNING → DONE → IDLE`. A failed/mismatched load goes to `ERROR` and auto-recovers after ~10 s.

**Dashboard — three panels (3×2 screen):**

```

```

Module panel shows each module's state, its job's distance/drone, and the per-load diagnostic. Dust panel marks `!` for items below threshold. Hardware panel shows the active priority mode, per-asteroid cap, telemetry freshness, live task count, drone stock, and drill-kit stock.

### `job_node.lua` — Mining Module Worker

**Hardware (shared per node):** T2 wireless card · OC Database component (tier 2, 25 slots — covers all 6 modules) · optional GPU + screen

**Hardware per module slot:** OC Adapter on Mining Module · OC Adapter on ME Interface · OC Transposer between ME Interface buffer and Input Bus

Plasma is supplied by hardware only — connect an ME Fluid Export Bus directly to each module's Input Hatch. The script does not load plasma.

On first run, auto-generates `/home/job_node_config.lua` with full comments and exits. Fill in addresses (use `component.list()` in the OC console), then restart.

**Node-level config field:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `dbAddr` | Shared OC Database component address. Tier 2 (25 slots) covers 6 modules. Each module uses 3 slots: M1→1-3, M2→4-6 … M6→16-18. |

**Per-module config fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `tier` | `"MK-I"`, `"MK-II"`, or `"MK-III"` |
| `moduleAddr` | OC Adapter on the Mining Module controller block |
| `ifaceAddr` | OC Adapter on the ME Interface |
| `transposerAddr` | OC Transposer between ME Interface and Input Bus |
| `interfaceSide` | Side of transposer facing the ME Interface buffer (0–5) |
| `inputBusSide` | Side of transposer facing the Input Bus (0–5) |
| `distanceParam` | `setParameters` index for distance — confirmed as `0` in-game |

**Per-module state machine** (advances every 0.5 s, all slots run concurrently):

```

                            └──[JOB_COMPLETE sent]──► IDLE ◄──────────────────┘
```

**Item loading sequence (confirmed in-game API path):**
1. `iface.store({label=name}, dbAddress, slot)` — write item fingerprint from ME into the shared database
2. `iface.setInterfaceConfiguration(slot, dbAddress, dbSlot, count)` — tell the interface to pull those items from ME into its buffer
3. Poll `transposer.getSlotStackSize(interfaceSide, slot)` until expected counts appear
4. `transposer.transferItem(interfaceSide, inputBusSide, count, fromSlot, toSlot)` — move to Input Bus
5. `iface.setInterfaceConfiguration(slot)` — clear the configuration so ME stops refilling

On completion, all items (including the unconsumed drone) are returned to ME by iterating the Input Bus slots via `transposer.transferItem`. Registers with the broker every 30 s so a broker restart picks up all nodes automatically.

## Deployment

### 1. Shared config

Copy `config.lua` to `/home/config.lua` on **every** computer in the system.

### 2. Telemetry nodes

**All three telem nodes are required** — dust (`dust_telem.lua`), hardware
(`hw_telem.lua`), and fluid/plasma (`fluid_telem.lua`). The broker stays at
"Waiting for telemetry..." and dispatches nothing until all three report. (Plasma
is required because mining modules physically can't run without a plasma fluid.)

Each telem node needs only its own script and `config.lua`:

```
/home/config.lua
/home/dust_telem.lua    (or hw_telem.lua / fluid_telem.lua)
```

Set `targetSide` at the top of each script to the side of the OC Adapter facing
the relevant ME Controller (dust node → dust-storage network; hardware node →
the network holding your drones/drill bits). Boot and leave running.

### 3. Broker MK3 (primary deployment)

Copy these to the broker computer:

```
/home/config.lua
/home/job_node_config.lua    (your module hardware addresses)
/home/broker-mk3.lua
/home/scheduler.lua
/home/loader.lua
/home/logger.lua
```

**First boot:**
1. Copy `job_node_config.example.lua` to `/home/job_node_config.lua` and fill in your hardware:
   - `dbAddr` — the shared OC Database (3 slots used per module)
   - per module: `tier`, `moduleAddr` (module controller adapter), `ifaceAddr` (ME interface adapter), `transposerAddr`, `interfaceSide`, `inputBusSide`
   - Find addresses with `list_components.lua`, or add modules with `detect_module.lua`.
2. Run `broker-mk3.lua`. It prompts for **priority mode** (Threshold / Rarity), then draws the dashboard and begins dispatching once telemetry arrives.

To stop it, break the script with **Ctrl+Alt+C** in the OC console.

### 4. Multi-node fleets (future / optional)

The single broker is limited by the host computer's component budget (≈6 modules on a typical bus; far more on a creative component bus). The shared database caps the fleet at **27 modules** (81 slots ÷ 3). To scale past one broker's component limit, `job_node.lua` can run remote workers on additional computers — each driving its own modules and partitioning into the shared database. This is the path back toward the multi-elevator architecture; the per-asteroid cap already scales with total module count.

---

## Job Flow

```
1. dust_telem broadcasts DUST_UPDATE (stock levels) every 120 s
2. fluid_telem broadcasts FLUID_UPDATE (plasma volumes) every 10 s
3. hw_telem broadcasts HW_UPDATE (drones/drills) every 10 s

4. Broker dispatch cycle (every 1 second):
   a. Get all idle modules from registered job nodes
   b. Build needs list from config.conditions (items below threshold)
   c. For each idle module:
      - Find next asteroid from needs list not on cooldown and not already being mined
      - Select best drone (highest tier within asteroid's minDrone/maxDrone, with stock > 0)
      - Verify drill consumables available
      - Look up optimal distance from config.optimizationMatrix
      - Broadcast JOB_ASSIGN on port 2027
   d. Mark dispatched asteroids to prevent double-assignment in this batch

5. Job node receives JOB_ASSIGN (checks msg.target == nodeId):
   a. store() fingerprints into db slots, setInterfaceConfiguration() to pull from ME
   b. Poll transposer slot sizes until drone + 4×parallels tips + rods are present
   c. transferItem() drone/tips/rods into Input Bus; clear interface config
   d. setParameters(0, 0, distance), setWorkAllowed(true)
   e. Poll isMachineActive() every 10 s (5 s startup grace period)

6. Job complete:
   a. Job node iterates Input Bus slots and returns all items (including drone) to ME
   b. Broadcasts JOB_COMPLETE; broker frees the module and sets pipelineCheckDelay cooldown
   c. After cooldown, broker re-evaluates and may re-dispatch the same asteroid
```

## Notes

- **`distanceParam` index** — confirmed as `0` in-game. The default in `job_node_config.lua` is already correct. Verify with `component.proxy(component.get("<moduleAddr>")).getParametersInfo()` if behaviour seems wrong.
- **Plasma supply** — the script does not load plasma. Connect an ME Fluid Export Bus directly to each module's Input Hatch and configure it to export the plasma type you want for that module. The broker selects plasma based on mode (best/single/tiered) and reports it in `hw_telem`; the physical export bus must be pre-configured to match.
- **Database slots** — each module uses 3 consecutive slots in the shared database (M1→1-3, M2→4-6, …). The script writes fingerprints at runtime via `store()` — the database does not need to be pre-loaded manually.
- **Ore → dust pipeline** — the broker triggers on dust levels, not ore. Ore outputs to an ore-processing subnet, then dusts arrive in the dust-storage subnet where `dust_telem` is watching. `pipelineCheckDelay` (default 120 s) is the cooldown the broker waits after a job completes before re-checking — tune this to your ore factory throughput.
- **Draconic Core** — always capped at 1 parallel regardless of module tier due to its 7.8 M EU/t draw per parallel. The broker enforces this automatically.
- **Distances > 200** — some entries in the optimization matrix are `201`+ (optimizer result exceeded the valid range). The broker clamps all dispatched distances to 200.
- **Component budget** — 6 modules × 3 components (module adapter + ME Interface adapter + transposer) = 18 + ~4 overhead (modem, GPU, database, computer) = 22 of the 32 OC component limit per computer.
